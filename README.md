This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

This project is created with TypeScript, Next.js App Router with Client Components, and React. Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js v14.x or later
npm v6.14.4 or later

If you are new to these technologies, we recommend you go through the official React, Next.js, and TypeScript tutorials first.

## Getting Started

### Dev Env Setup
Create a `.env` file.
Refer to `.env.example` for the required keys.
Use the env values from Amplify QA environment.

### Run the Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
